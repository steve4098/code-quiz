# code-quiz

This application uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The JavaScript elements create an interactive multiple-choice quiz about coding, in which the user clicks on the answer which they believe to be correct. 
Answers are accompanied by sounds and a feedback word to show whether their answer was correct or incorrect. Incorrect answers are penalised by a reduction of 10 seconds from the timer. 
When the timer reaches 0 or all questions a have been answered, the quiz is over and the user has a chance to save their high-score. 
Scores are stored in Local Storage and can be viewed in an ordered table - there is an option to clear all scores.
